Caching your GitHub password in Git

git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set git to use the credential memory cache

git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)


Only new commits on the branch will be synced at a push


Update Concept Map
Push/pull operates on branches
Push/pull operate on remote
Git is part of GitHub
Remote . . .

# Forking
Forking allows you to make a copy of another repo on the GitHub servers without pulling down the code to your local machine first.
Fork an existing repo and have it appear on your account.
Then pull down the code and make changes
A fork is just a clone that github makes on their own servers
The number of forks made is tracked and will link back to the original

Identify a Branch, Fork or Clone
Clones can be local or remote
Clone can work on any two repos

# Clone the remote repo
git clone https://github.com/brkeegan/recipes.git

# Check the remote info
git remote -v

# Make a new local file and push it to the remote
git add <FILE_NAME>
git commit
git status
git log
git push origin master

# Section 12
# Question on location of commit

It is possible to have conflicts when you are working on a repo using different machines. collaborating or making changes directly in github

Cloning sets up a remote for you called origin
When you clone a repository you get a local branch called master which points to the same commit as the remote one.
git fetch updates the local copy of the remote branch

git pull origin master = git fetch origin, git merge origin/master

git log and git status run without web access
