# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When you want to share a project 

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To give you better control over what gets updated

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Clones can be local or remote and are a copy of a repo
   Clones can work on any two repos
   Branch is a divergence from the main/master track which allows experimental features or bugs to be worked on whilst maintaining a working copy
   Fork is new version of a repo which links back to the original but allows independent development to take place without affecting the orginal


# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
This will enable the user to know the point when the remote was last accessed for change. This allows the user to determine any new changes that were made that may have diverged from the original
    

# How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It may be possible to collaborate using a shared folder. This would be difficult to maintain if there were lots of people working on it. However, for very small teams it may be quicker and less complex.

# When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   Working in this way allows independent changes to be made without affecting the main branch. It also encourages proposed changes to be reviewd by others before commiting the changes.
